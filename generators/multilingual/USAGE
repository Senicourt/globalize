Description:
    Generates a new migration that creates and populates the multilingual db tables.
    All tables are prefixed with "multilingual_", so they won't conflict with 
    other application tables. Run 'rake migrate' afterwards to synch the db.

Example:
    ./script/generate multilingual

    This will create:
	db/migrate/xxx_multilingual.rb
