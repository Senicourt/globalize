HOW TO MAKE A NEW TRANSLATION

To add another translation, find the iso3166 and iso639-1 tables for your
language and create the ISO 3166 and ISO 639-1 .dat-files. The .dat files
must use UTF-8 charset.

You may want to search your local wikipedia or find a non-copyleft Open Source
project to get the translation data. Put a comment on top of the .dat-file saying
where you got the data from.

Then run generate_files.rb to generate the locales and if everything seems
good, send the .dat-files to tuxie@dekadance.se for inclusion in the main
distribution.


ISO 3166 FILES (countries)

The ISO 3166 .dat-file format is:
iso3166 numeric | formal name | common name
The common name is optional. If skipped the formal named will be used.
An example of a country with different formal/common name is China:
156 | China, People's Republic of | China

The iso3166 numeric value may contain leading zeroes.

The file must must have the name iso3166-#{language}.dat. For example
"iso3166-sv.dat" for the Swedish translation.


ISO 639-1 FILES (languages)

The ISO 639-1 .dat-file format is:
code | language

Example:
sv | Swedish

The code is case insensitive.

The file must have the name iso639-1-#{language}.dat. For example
"iso639-1-sv.dat" for the Swedish translation.
