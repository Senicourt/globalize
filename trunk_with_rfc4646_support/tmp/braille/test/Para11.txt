I HEAR THAT THEY ARE AT LOGGERHEADS OVER THE AFFAIR: THEY ACCUSE THE BEGGAR OF ROBBING THEM AND BAGGING ALL THE STUFF CONCEALED BENEATH A MUDDLED HEAP OF RUBBISH; HOW HE LEARNT THIS FACT AND CLEARED OUT THE STUFF, BAG AND BAGGAGE, AND EFFACED EVERY TRACE QUITE BAFFLED THE WEARY WATCHMAN WHO HEARD NOTHING DURING THE NIGHT (AT LEAST, SO HE AFFIRMS), AND ONLY WITH DIFFICULTY REALISED TOWARDS MORNING THAT A VERY SERIOUS BREACH OF THE PEACE OCCURRED AS HE SLEPT HUDDLED UP ALL OF A HEAP, WITH MUFFLED UP EARS. YOU MAY CONSIDER IT ODD, BUT I WILL NOT EAT CABBAGE. THE SUFFERERS FROM THE DISASTER DID NOT GIVE UP THE STRUGGLE. BEING A STIFF-NECKED OLD ARISTOCRAT SHE DID NOT MINGLE WITH THE COMMON RABBLE, BUT THEY WEARIED OF BEING TREATED LIKE RIFFRAFF. THE LEADER OF THE PLOT, BEING ACCUSED, CRIED "I AM NOT GUILTY!"; ALL THE SAME, THE JUDGES CONDEMNED THE MAN. THEY SERVED MEATLOAF, FRIED EGGPLANT, CARROTS AND PEAS, CRUSTY BREAD, PEACHES AND CREAM AND CAKE TOPPED WITH FLUFFY MARSHMALLOW FROSTING. THE STORY (WHICH WE WILL SOON COMPLETE) IS FILLED WITH HORROR. "DO YOU CONSIDER THAT OLD PEDDLER ODD?" IT IS NOT SO EASY FOR ME! HE FEARED THE MAN WITH THE GUN; BUT WITH EFFORT HE DISARMED THE BRUTE. HE CAN AFFORD THIS PROPERTY BECAUSE HE IS A MAN OF MEANS - LUCKY MAN!
