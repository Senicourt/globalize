"I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT YOU WERE DOING," HE SAID AFTER COMING IN. "WHY," I REPLIED, "I WAS ABOUT MY OWN AFFAIRS AGAIN, AND THAT IS ENOUGH!" I WAS ALMOST TIRED OF HIS INTERFERING WAYS: HE WAS ALWAYS ASKING INDISCREET THINGS OF THAT KIND, ALTHOUGH HE ALREADY KNEW ENOUGH ABOUT ME AS IT WAS. WE WERE ALL, IN A GROUP ON THE PLATFORM, WAITING FOR THE INCOMING TRAIN; BEFORE IT CAME IN - IT WAS VERY LATE - WE SAW MY BLOODY UNBELIEVABLE BROTHER-IN-LAW WITH HIS - WHAT DID HE CALL IT? - HIS "MASCOT". THEN THE TRAIN CAME IN: IT WAS ALMOST TWENTY MINUTES BEHIND SCHEDULE. "ENOUGH STANDING ABOUT, FOR ME AT LEAST," I SAID. "QUITE ENOUGH FOR US ALSO!" MY COMPANIONS AGREED. "BUT BE NIMBLE," I SAID, "THE TRAIN WILL BE STARTING OFF AGAIN IN A MINUTE AND WE SHALL HAVE BEEN WAITING IN VAIN." WE ALL GOT IN ALTHOUGH IT WAS ABOUT FULL ALREADY. MY BROTHER-IN-LAW, WHO JOINED US AND JUMPED IN AFTER US WITH HIS PET IN HIS ARMS, WAS ALMOST TOO LATE; WE WERE OFF AT LAST. AFTER IT LOST THE WAY, THE PLANE STRAYED BEYOND THE SOVIET BORDER AND WAS SHOT DOWN BEHIND THE IRON CURTAIN. HIS HOME TOWN IS ACCORDING THE GENERAL AN ALMOST ROYAL WELCOME BECAUSE OF HIS HEROIC STAND AGAINST OVERWHELMING ODDS. WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH FOOD IN THE NEW HOUSE FOR THE ENTIRE WEEKEND. WHEN MY IN-LAWS INVADED OUR DOMAIN I WAS IN STATE OF FRENZY. IF YOU INSIST THAT I BE FRANK, I WILL BE. HOW FEW THEY WERE, YET HOW WELL THEY DEFENDED THE HOMELAND! "ENOUGH'S ENOUGH!" CRIED THE INFURIATED PARENT. THE HEADMASTER WASN'T IN, BUT HIS SECRETARY GREETED US WARMLY. DICKENS AND THACKERAY WERE IMPORTANT BRITISH NOVELISTS OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY. HE MOVINGLY RECITED TENNYSON'S "IN MEMORIAM" IN FLOODS OF TEARS. MAYBE HE'LL CHANGE HIS MIND!
