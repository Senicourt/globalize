I can never conceive how my sister-in-law manages the cleaning and the cooking and the shopping and everything for the children - day in, day out - too much altogether to my mind! For however good they may be in a general way, children are ever a great charge on the father and mother - greater, moreover, on the mother. "Well I don't know," she declared yesterday, when I demanded to know how she could fit it all into the seven days; "every day I have to do certain things, whatever else may have to go by the board; here's a list if you'd like to know: Monday is washing-day - as everybody knows - by good luck, Father likes to take the children to school on that day - Tuesdays and Wednesdays I go into the town to do my shopping - would you believe people could stand in queues, never knowing whether they will get anything much after all? Such a great waste of good effort! Still, it's either that or nothing!" Here she broke off suddenly with: "Why here they are and I'm not ready with tea!"
