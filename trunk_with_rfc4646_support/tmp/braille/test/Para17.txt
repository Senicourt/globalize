At a peace-time house-party at Lord Broughton's there were quite a considerable number of young people; some of the younger ones not knowing what to do with themselves all day and eager to try something new while they were all together there, suggested they ought to get up to play. And this plan was quickly put into effect. By good luck one of the party was discovered to be some sort of play-wright. Before the day was out the play was chosen and most of the characters in it were allotted. Everyone was set to work to get his part by heart immediately; someone was sent to help the youngest of the party to learn his part; he was a promising youngster with plenty of character who was thought eminently suitable to play the part of the young hero. The next thing to settle was where the play ought to be staged. Someone immediately perceived that there was a large room with a door behind leading into a little lobby, through which the actors could pass in and out at will. The great day was fixed and the young people went to work with the right good will.
