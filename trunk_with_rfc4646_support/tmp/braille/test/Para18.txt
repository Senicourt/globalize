The young people, intent upon the task of learning the words which fell under the parts assigned to them, worked hard during the time left to them, before the great day fixed by the playwright who was also the producer. He insisted upon the immediate need for everyone to be word-perfect and to know his or her part in the play before they could even begin to rehearse. "This is still more necessary," he said, "for those, whose parts represent the chief characters in the play; these should study the characters they are called to act, try to understand them and not only get the words by heart but spend as much time on them as they can." And so hard did these enthusiastic young people work throughout those few days that remained, that even those high standards set by the playwright seemed within reach. In the meantime the older ones of the party set to work upon the necessary accessories to the staging considered essential by the producer. Several rehearsals a day were insisted upon by those taking part.
