The party of young people had many exciting times over their recitals. Some days nothing went right. "Put more spirit into those words!" one of them would be told. "Why in the world you cannot speak out!" or "there's a world of thought behind those lines of yours and you ought to enter into their spirit, so that those who hear them cannot fail to understand these underlying ideas." The youngster, whose part was that of the young hero, had worked very hard to get his words quite right and say them in a spirited manner: many and many a time he had been heard declaiming them to himself and to anyone else who had enough time to listen to him. Here and there, where particular lines had to be said in some more characteristic tone of voice, those who had to speak them had to spend more time upon perfecting themselves. At last the great day arrived, when they would have to face all those who had come to look on - all the world and his wife were there, and their hearts sank. Their spirits rallied however, and they "brought down the house".
