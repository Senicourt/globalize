I AM FOND OF A CUP OF TEA WITH A BUN; AND, WITH THE BUN YOU CAN GIVE ME A PIECE OF CAKE. BUSY AS USUAL, I SEE, WITH THE POTS AND PANS; AND IF I MAY ADD, WITH THE SPOONS AND KNIVES AND THE NEW BRONZES ON THE MANTELPIECE AND THE WALLS; FOR IF YOU SEE A PRETTY BIT OF BRASS FOR SALE YOU GO AND BUY IT AND HANG IT UP FOR THE JOY THAT IT WILL GIVE AND THE RAPTURE IT EVOKES. AT HOME HE HAS BOXES AND BASKETS FULL OF ALL SORTS OF FRUIT AS FOR EXAMPLE ORANGES AND LEMONS AND APPLES AND BANANAS AND PLUMS AND FIGS, AND NUTS OF THE SORT THAT YOU LIKE, AS WELL AS LOTS OF THE LOVELY PRUNES THAT I GOT FROM ABROAD A FEW WEEKS AGO. I HAVE A LOT OF WORRY WITH THE DOGS AND THE HORSES; AND THE PIGS AND THE GOATS AND THE CATS. HE LOOKS ON ALL THE DAMAGE FROM THE FIRE WITH THE HABITUAL, PLACID CALM OF A MAN THAT FEELS DEEPLY BUT WILL NOT LET ANYBODY ELSE SEE IT. THE MAN THAT LIVES NEXT DOOR TOOK LUKE AND ME FOR A RIDE ON THE BUS. HE SPOKE THE PHRASE WITH EMPHASIS. YOU WILL SOON SEE THE VALUE OF TRAVEL ABROAD. IT HELPS YOU RELAX AND IT GIVES YOU AN IDEA OF THE WAY PEOPLE LIVE. JOHN TOLD NEIL THAT JUICY BIT OF GOSSIP, BUT DID NOT TELL LYNN. I WILL LIVE WITH AND PROVIDE FOR THE OLD MAN. I WILL GIVE THE GIRL I AM FOND OF A NEW HAT. THE TREE IS SO TALL THAT HE CAN JUST SEE THE BIG LIMB IF HE IS ON THE VERY TOP OF A WIDE, FLAT ROCK. TALK WITH US AND, IF WE CAN, WE WILL HELP A JUST CAUSE OF AND FOR THE PEOPLE.
